            <div id="philosophy">
                <p>I am a <strong>Generalist</strong> who cannot be stopped by anything
                    when it comes to learning new things.
                    Learning is Freedom and being a Generalist gifts you that Freedom. I believe that
                    a person must not confine himself to a specialisation. Although, going on a path does gives
                    you a sort of expertise. But to maintain that kind of expertise, all you need to do is turn your
                    hobbies to skills. This would help you remain in touch with them despite your professional
                    specialisations.
                    Plus, whenever you would want to change paths the corporate of the contemporary world looks at
                    projects more rather
                    than experience which you will have in loads. Hence, I am a nomad that learns new stuff
                    and tries them and polishes my skills in them to the professional level</p>

                    <li>I have third rank in <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/SaadAleem">Code Wars</a>.
                        This showcases my capabilities in Python.</li>
                    <li>Understanding Customer Churn: This project was a classification problem
                        which showed me the problems that can arise with the accuracy of the results.

                <p>I created three projects on C#. All three of them integrated SQL with C# in .Net Framework.
                    Those projects were basically management of different databases with Windows Form Graphical User
                    Interface.
                    One of my C# integrations with Microsoft Access is <a

            <div class="panel" style="display: none;">
                <p>I started working with Linux three years back. I installed Kali Linux then for almost a year. This
                    was
                    because I believe that I learn best when I am pushed into experiencing. Hence, that is what i did.
                    I am now a user of Ubuntu and I am quiet good at it.

            <div class="panel" style="display: none;">
                <p>I believe that this website is a true showcase of my Web Designing and FrontEnd Development
                    capabilities. I did develop a Django website before but I took most of the things from
                    Bootstrap. This website of mine is my own harcoded one.
